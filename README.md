## QuestionPlease project

A very simple question game, based on [Open Trivia DB questions](https://opentdb.com/)

## Why ?

It is my first website ! I used this simple project to learn and exercise on several tech and frameworks :

- React/Redux
- TypeScript
- Azure Functions in .NET
- Azure CosmosDB
- Azure authentification process (Authorization Code Flow)
- Azure pipelines
- [CSS-in-JS with Material-UI's styling solution](https://material-ui.com/styles/basics/)

## Installation

Clone the repository
Then go to your local repo

    npm install
    npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Features

2 modes : with and without authentification

### With authentification

SignIn with your Windows account (any Microsoft account - personnal or organizationnal) :

- you'll be asked to choose a login
- the app will keep track of your score between sessions
- your score will be displayed in the leaderboard with your login (only if you are in the top 3 players)
- you'll never have the same question twice unless you choose to Retry the question

### Without authentification

- No login to choose
- Your score will not appear in the leaderboard
- You may have to answers the same question twice (or more)
